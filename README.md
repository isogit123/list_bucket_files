# List Bucket Files
This is an example code showing how to list files inside an AWS S3 Bucket.

To run the code, you need to configure IAM access for the code to run. You can refer to the following links to get started:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/sdk-general-information-section.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-static-credentials.html

After that, in a command prompt, run the following:
```
npm install
```
to install the required dependencies, then run:
```
node index.js
```
to run the sample.
